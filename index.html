        <p class="blue-text" id="hi">A festival that lasts for three consecutive days and brings together over 16,000 dancers and musicians from across Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. It represents a powerful fusion of Aymara, Quechua, and Afro-descendant traditions, celebrating the cultural identity of the triple-border region.</p>
        <p class="blue-text" id="hello">The carnival transforms the streets of the border city of Arica into a giant stage. The parade route weaves through the city center and reaches its climax at a massive stage located at the foot of the iconic Morro de Arica, a historic coastal cliff that can be seen from everywhere in the small city.</p>
        <p class="blue-text" id="howdy">More than just a party, the festival is a deep spiritual tribute to the Pachamama (Mother Earth) and the Tata Inti (Father Sun). It serves as a vital act of cultural preservation, ensuring that the indigenous and regional heritage of the Andes remains alive and thriving for future generations. It is a free event that attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators, the andean celebration then continues at the Carnival of Oruro.</p>
