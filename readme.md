My first website ever!

However I cannot claim full credit since I used a bunch of AI.
First I used Claude for the skeleton, mostly to play around and understand the structure. Then I used Lovable for the page I have here, I uploaded a pic from a website as reference and then ask the AI to keep it as simple as possible so I could understand and play around. After that, I asked Gemini for help with the image folder and to make ajustments.
